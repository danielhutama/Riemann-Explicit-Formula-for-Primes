# Riemann's Explicit Formula Implementation source code

Author: Daniel Hutama, McGill University Desautels Faculty of Management

This repository contains source code used to make all illustrations in *Implementation of Riemann's Explicit Formula for Rational and Gaussian Primes in Sage*. This report has also been uploaded as a PDF file, titled "Explicit\_Formula\_Sage." This PDF file should be considered as the full readme for this repository.  

There are 4 main files, which cover psi(x) and pi(x) for rational and Gaussian primes. In addition, there is a 5th file which compares the exponential integral against x/log(x).
